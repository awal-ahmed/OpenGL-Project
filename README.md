# OpenGL-Project
This game contains 2 cars. A player can control the direction of the first cir. This game also counts points. If the player can't control the car and touch the boundary of the road, then the car automatically tries to set its direction. But the speed and point will increase slowly.
In this game, 2 lights are available. One of them is global light and another is head light. A Player can decide and turn off/on those lights. Player can control the ambient, diffuse and specular of those lights.
Player can pause the game whenever he wants. It will not affect the game.
In the game, if the second car touches the first can, then the  game ends.

## Visualization ##
Those two cars are rotating around a park. This park contains general things like lake, bridge, bench, playground as well as some monuments like shohid minar, sriti shoudho etc. The player can pause the game and make a tour in the park.
